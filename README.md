## Overview
This report has been prepared in response to the Covid-19 Hackathon challenge organised by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and Cranfield University.

This hackthon report provides an overview of the data analysis that has been carried out to explore the relationship between air quality and the severity of COVID-19 infection. 

The datasets used in this study, have been gathered from multiple data sources, including [aqicn.org](https://aqicn.org). The visualisations presented in this report have been developed using Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook environment.

Key steps followed to prepare this report are:

1. Define a solution approach
2. Acquire relevant datasets
3. Explore, clean and wrangle datasets
4. Identify patterns and create visualisation
5. Summerise the key findings

A detailed description of each step can be found in this [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/shbitservices/NERC-Hackathon-1-Air-Quality/tree/master/code/H1-Covid-19-and-Air-Quality.ipynb). This notebook is stored in the `code` sub-directory of this repository. The report has been prepared by running each of the cells in this notebook in a jupyter notebook environment spawned from Anaconda Navigator.

Rows with blank values have also been dropped from this combined file and a new set of metrics has been added to this file. This file has been created from an intermediate file df_aq_cd_may_data.csv. 

+ [data/aq_day1_joined_cd_day7_with_metrics.csv](https://github.com/shbitservices/NERC-Hackathon-1-Air-Quality/tree/master/data/aq_day1_joined_cd_day7_with_metrics.csv) - This file has been created for iteration 2. Please refer to section 4.2.1 for details on this dataset.
